How to compile packJPG (01/30/2012)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document gives detailed instructions on compiling packJPG either as 
an executable or a static/shared library. 


Compiling packJPG as an executable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Makefiles or provided for Microsoft Windows NT ('Makefile') and Unix 
('Makefile.unix'). Both have been tested and verified to work in GCC 
v3.4.5, but they should work with other compilers and newer/older 
versions of the GCC as well. If you want to compile packJPG in Microsoft 
Visual Studio for Microsoft Windows, just create a new project and add 
all source files to it. 


Compiling packJPG as a static or shared library 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

If you want to compile packJPG as a static or shared library, add all 
the source files to a new static/shared library project. 'BUILD_LIB' 
(without the ') has to be defined either at the beginning of 
'packJPG.cpp' or from the compilers options. 'BUILD_DLL' has to be 
defined in addition only if a shared library is to be compiled (don't 
define this for a static library!).

The source file 'packJPGdll.h' contains all public function declarations 
of the library and can be included in external projects which use the 
packJPG shared library. 


Compiling developer functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

If you want to include developer functions in the packJPG executable, 
'DEV_BUILD' has to be defined. Developer functions are not available in 
the packJPG library. They are not needed in any way for basic packJPG 
functionality (i.e. compression and decompression) and can be left out 
to compile a smaller executable. Read 'developer.txt' for more 
information. 


Defines overview / summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

This paragraph gives a short overview over preprocessor defines 
mentioned in the above paragraphs. 

BUILD_LIB
Has to be defined when compiling a static or shared library. 

BUILD_DLL
Has to defined when compiling a shared library only. 

BUILD_DEV
If this is defined, developer functions are included in the executable. 
In library builds developer functions are not available.
